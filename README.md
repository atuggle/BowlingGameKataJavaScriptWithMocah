## Description
This is a small repository demonstrating TDD using the Bowling Game Kata.  This will be done with JavaScript and using Mocha as the test runner

### Rules to TDD (Red, Green, Blue)
1. Only write enough of a test to get it to fail
2. Only write enough code to get it to pass
3. Refactor

The Idea to good TDD is your test should force you to write new code and you only write enough new code to make the test pass.  This way all your code is tested.

### Steps/Tests to write
1. Can create game object
2. Can bowl all gutter game 
3. Can bowl all 1's
4. Can bowl a spare
5. Can bowl a strike
